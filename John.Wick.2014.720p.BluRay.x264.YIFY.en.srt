1
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:40,142
It looks like the storm
has passed, New Yorkers.

2
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:43,062
A season-high seven inches
of rain last night.

3
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:45,102
High winds and flooding in some areas...

4
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,182
even left some New Yorkers stranded.

5
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:49,102
City crews still working this morning.

6
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,126
They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.

7
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,582
Good news is, today should be sunny
with highs in the low 60s...

8
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,742
unseasonably mild...

9
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:01,142
a real change from the relentless
weather of these past few weeks.

10
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:04,702
So get out there, enjoy the sun,
go to the park, get outside if you can...

11
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:06,804
because it's not gonna last long.

12
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:08,822
Winter storms are turning
later in the week...

13
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:12,022
making for a severe temperature drop
over the weekend.

14
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:15,092
Could be signs for an early
and potentially long winter.

15
00:01:39,162 --> 00:01:41,324
What are you doing, John?

16
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,129
Looking at you.

17
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:46,166
Come here.

18
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:53,924
Are you still filming?

19
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:16,142
It looks like the storm
has passed, New Yorkers.

20
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,062
A season-high seven inches
of rain last night.

21
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:21,130
High winds and flooding in some areas...

22
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:23,222
even left some New Yorkers stranded.

23
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,142
City crews still working this morning.

24
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:28,142
They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.

25
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:31,582
Good news is, today should be sunny
with highs in the low 60s...

26
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:33,764
unseasonably mild...

27
00:04:58,002 --> 00:04:59,845
I'm up. I'm up.

28
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,288
I'm u... I'm up.

29
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:36,050
All right. Come on, then.

30
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,446
How you doin'?

31
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:54,807
You need to go?

32
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:09,933
Nice ride.

33
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:14,773
Mustang. Boss 429.

34
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,729
- She a '70?
- '69.

35
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:23,288
- Beautiful car.
- Thanks.

36
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:52,852
It's been a while.

37
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,806
My condolences.

38
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,013
How are you holding up?

39
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,862
I keep asking, "Why her?"

40
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:06,262
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

41
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:09,730
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

42
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,286
Are you sure?

43
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,446
Don't blame yourself.

44
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,412
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

45
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,602
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

46
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:24,493
Is it here?

47
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,804
It was.

48
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:41,684
- I asked you where the hell did you get it?
- Who gives a shit?

49
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,689
Iosef Tarasov nicked it.

50
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:46,687
Viggo's son.

51
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:50,047
Yeah.

52
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,302
Get out of my shop. Get out right now.

53
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,770
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?
Because we own you.

54
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,902
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

55
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:08,527
We own you.

56
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,542
You don't own me, punk.

57
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:13,690
I work with your father. All right?

58
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:18,006
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

59
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,142
No.

60
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,822
We sure as hell fucked up his dog.

61
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:24,382
You fucked up his dog?
That's what you did?

62
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,102
Yeah.

63
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:27,931
That's crazy shit, man.

64
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,022
Oh, look at you. That's great.

65
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:37,382
You're gonna come into my shop
and pull a gun on me.

66
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:39,982
That's great, man. Come on.

67
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,702
Now, you kill me right now...

68
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:45,090
or you get the fuck out of my shop.

69
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:50,422
Viggo is not gonna like this.

70
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:53,342
How do you know what
Viggo likes or doesn't like?

71
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,763
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

72
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:02,126
You've got a fuckin' pair
on you, old man!

73
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,565
I guess we'll be takin' our
business someplace else.

74
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,607
So what are you gonna do?

75
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,490
I need a ride.

76
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:42,483
Aurelio speaking.

77
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:47,164
I heard you struck my son.

78
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,142
- Yes, sir, I did.
- And may I ask why?

79
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:54,782
Yeah, well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir...

80
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:58,284
and... killed his dog.

81
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,691
Viggo.

82
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:37,102
Yeah?

83
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:39,045
They've agreed to your terms.

84
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:43,649
It's not like you gave them much
of a choice anyway though, right?

85
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,326
Congratulations.

86
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,133
Sir?

87
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,724
Have you seen my son?

88
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,662
How was your trip, kid?

89
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:18,222
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

90
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,847
Or ever.

91
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:45,452
That's a nice jacket.

92
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,283
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

93
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:01,170
Should I go?

94
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,973
- Viggo, English, please. Come on.
- Stay, goddamn it!

95
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,885
What did I do?

96
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:15,724
We did what you asked. No one saw shit.

97
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,368
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

98
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:25,222
What then?

99
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:28,462
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

100
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:29,862
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

101
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:31,805
- Christ, Viggo.
- You stay!

102
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,942
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

103
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,942
It's who you did it to.

104
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,693
Who? That fucking nobody?

105
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:04,524
That "fuckin' nobody"...

106
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:08,007
is John Wick.

107
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,973
He once was an associate of ours.

108
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:30,123
They call him Baba Yaga.

109
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,453
The boogeyman?

110
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,690
Well, John wasn't exactly the boogeyman.

111
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:44,723
He was the one you sent to
kill the fucking boogeyman.

112
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:53,087
John is a man of focus...

113
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:55,408
commitment...

114
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,527
sheer will.

115
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:01,732
Something you know very little about.

116
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:06,982
I once saw him kill
three men in a bar...

117
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,243
with a pencil.

118
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,082
With a fuckin'...

119
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:15,886
pencil.

120
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:26,925
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

121
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,444
It's over a woman, of course.

122
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:38,250
So I made a deal with him.

123
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,413
I gave him an impossible task.

124
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,764
A job no one could have pulled off.

125
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:56,926
The bodies he buried that day...

126
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:01,205
laid the foundation of what we are now.

127
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:07,292
And then, my son...

128
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,928
a few days after his wife died...

129
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:13,493
you steal his car...

130
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,422
and kill his fuckin' dog.

131
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,462
Father, I can make this right.

132
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,542
Oh. How do you plan that?

133
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:25,342
By finishing what I started.

134
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,570
Did he hear a fucking word I said?

135
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:32,608
Iosef, Iosef, listen.

136
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:37,844
John will come for you.

137
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,222
And you will do nothing...

138
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,342
because you can do nothing.

139
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:50,093
So get the fuck out of my sight.

140
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,812
Hello, John.

141
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,102
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.

142
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,727
My condolences.

143
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:34,302
It seems to be fate, or happenstance...

144
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:38,487
or just bad fuckin' luck caused
our paths to cross once again.

145
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:44,726
John?

146
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:51,982
Let us not resort to
our baser instincts...

147
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,653
and handle this like civilized men...

148
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,491
to move on...

149
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:08,846
What'd he say?

150
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:13,604
- Enough.
- Oh, God.

151
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:19,283
Task a crew.

152
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,013
H-How many?

153
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:24,602
How many do you have?

154
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:35,742
Evenin', John.

155
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:37,942
Evenin', Jimmy.

156
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,646
Noise complaint?

157
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:42,731
Noise complaint.

158
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:57,488
- You... workin' again?
- No, just sortin' some stuff out.

159
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:00,450
Ah, well...

160
00:23:03,122 --> 00:23:05,502
I'll leave you be then.

161
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:08,082
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

162
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,222
This is Wick.

163
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,462
Yes, John Wick. That's right.

164
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:31,771
I'd like to make a dinner
reservation for 12.

165
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,502
Good to see you, John.

166
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:54,172
Charlie.

167
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:08,862
You look good.

168
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:12,011
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

169
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:57,086
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

170
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,450
Good-bye, Charlie.

171
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,530
John.

172
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:08,485
Of course he did.

173
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:12,262
Put a contract on John Wick.

174
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:13,942
How much?

175
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:16,124
Two million.

176
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,045
English, Viggo, please.

177
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:32,766
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

178
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:35,822
For what?

179
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:38,687
For John Wick, of course.

180
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,166
Thank you.

181
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,682
To what do I owe this visit?

182
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:16,182
I have a job for you.

183
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:17,932
And I've got a phone.

184
00:26:20,202 --> 00:26:22,853
I want to offer you this face to face...

185
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:27,448
seeing as how you might
find it personal.

186
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:31,767
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

187
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:38,091
After all, you were close.

188
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:43,222
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.

189
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:46,326
It's a timely matter.
It has to be handled quickly.

190
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,931
Consider it done.

191
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,542
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.

192
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,292
Thanks for the drink.

193
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:01,642
Room 918. Do enjoy your stay.

194
00:29:01,762 --> 00:29:03,366
Thanks.

195
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:07,087
Good seeing you again, John.

196
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:09,452
Perkins.

197
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:14,142
I have you for two nights.

198
00:29:14,242 --> 00:29:17,052
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.

199
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:21,222
So when did the old
place get a face lift?

200
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:22,742
Around four years ago.

201
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,182
But I assure you, sir...

202
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:26,182
she really hasn't changed much.

203
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:28,933
- Same owner?
- Same owner.

204
00:29:37,162 --> 00:29:38,288
Room 818.

205
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,572
And, as always...

206
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:44,102
it is a pleasure...

207
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:47,763
having you with us again, Mr. Wick.

208
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:04,925
What are you doing, John?

209
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,486
Looking at you.

210
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:09,967
Come here.

211
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:44,531
Hello, Winston.

212
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:48,012
Jonathan.

213
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:52,142
Now, as I recall...

214
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:56,502
weren't you the one tasked to dole
out the beatings, not receive them?

215
00:31:56,602 --> 00:31:58,172
Rusty, I guess.

216
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:00,925
To what do we owe the pleasure?

217
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,604
Iosef Tarasov.

218
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:08,447
- What about him?
- I'd like to talk with him.

219
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:12,251
A talk, you say.

220
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:17,362
I'm familiar with
the parlance, Jonathan.

221
00:32:18,162 --> 00:32:20,662
I want to ask you this.

222
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,764
Have you returned to the fold?

223
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:26,182
Just visiting.

224
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:28,302
Have you thought this through?

225
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:32,293
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

226
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:35,782
You got out once.

227
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:38,886
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond...

228
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:43,822
you may well find
something reaches out...

229
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,382
and drags you back into its depths.

230
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:48,530
Where do I find him?

231
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:54,248
Hey. Wick's at the Continental.

232
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:58,542
Welcome home, John.

233
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,462
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.

234
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,212
Yeah?

235
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,046
How brazen.

236
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:12,262
If they're willing to break the rules
of Continental, double the bounty.

237
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:14,742
You know the rules.

238
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:17,062
No business can be conducted
on these premises...

239
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:21,008
lest incurring heavy penalties.

240
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:25,487
Have a drink...

241
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,166
and relax...

242
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:33,564
for now.

243
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,412
It's personal.

244
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:44,542
I want caviar for breakfast
and champagne every night

245
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:47,102
Holy shit. Jonathan.

246
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:49,142
- Hey, Addy.
- My God!

247
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:52,142
How long has it been? Four years?

248
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,502
Five and change.

249
00:33:53,602 --> 00:33:57,462
So tell me, how was life
on the other side?

250
00:33:57,562 --> 00:33:59,422
It was good, Addy.

251
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,604
Far better than I deserved.

252
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,662
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your...

253
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,332
Thanks.

254
00:34:07,642 --> 00:34:10,102
I've never seen you like this.

255
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,567
Like what?

256
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:14,167
Vulnerable.

257
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:17,568
I'm retired.

258
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:20,170
Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not.

259
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:23,702
- Usual?
- Please.

260
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:26,542
But I'll empty your pockets

261
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:29,168
Leave you in misery

262
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:33,142
- Compliments of the house.
- Thanks.

263
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:35,222
I'll empty your pockets

264
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:39,771
Leave you in misery

265
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:46,086
Did you see the tits on that girl?

266
00:36:47,802 --> 00:36:49,725
I hope Lita is working tonight.

267
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:08,302
Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman?

268
00:37:08,402 --> 00:37:10,404
- I'm not.
- No?

269
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,803
But you should be.

270
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:19,446
I want another bottle!

271
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,565
Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle!

272
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:26,252
Come on!

273
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,206
Hello, Francis.

274
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:38,811
Mr. Wick.

275
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,363
Are you here on business, sir?

276
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:50,886
Afraid so, Francis.

277
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:54,607
Why don't you take the night off.

278
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,373
Thank you, sir.

279
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,087
Fuck you, motherfucker.

280
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:42,844
Where is Iosef?

281
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,843
Bathhouse, downstairs.

282
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,966
Go!

283
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:25,687
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

284
00:44:05,962 --> 00:44:07,532
Get in! Get in!

285
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:09,648
Come on! Come on!

286
00:45:54,762 --> 00:45:56,422
Good evening, Mr. Wick.

287
00:45:56,522 --> 00:45:57,662
Good evening.

288
00:45:57,762 --> 00:45:59,102
How may I be of service?

289
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:02,126
- Is the doctor in?
- Yes, sir. 24/7.

290
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:04,085
- Send him up, please.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:05,692
How good's your laundry?

292
00:46:07,562 --> 00:46:10,532
I'm sorry to say
that no one's that good.

293
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:13,982
No. I thought not.

294
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:16,902
May I suggest a drink, sir.

295
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:18,492
Bourbon, perhaps.

296
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:21,611
That sounds perfect.

297
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:38,328
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?

298
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:41,022
Well, if you're lookin' to heal...

299
00:46:41,122 --> 00:46:42,647
then keep it marginal.

300
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,022
However, if you still have...

301
00:46:47,122 --> 00:46:48,806
business to attend to...

302
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,009
take two of these beforehand.

303
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:58,763
Your stitches'll tear
and you'll bleed...

304
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,542
but you'll have full function.

305
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:03,565
Do you need anything for the pain?

306
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:07,289
No, I've got that covered.

307
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:15,243
Hey, John.

308
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:21,088
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.

309
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:24,651
I noticed.

310
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,902
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.

311
00:48:35,002 --> 00:48:36,822
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

312
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:39,368
That's unwise, I assure you.

313
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,251
You were always a pussy.

314
00:50:03,162 --> 00:50:04,062
Yes?

315
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:07,142
I apologize for calling you
at this hour...

316
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:10,982
but we have received a number
of grievances from your floor...

317
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:12,686
concerning the noise.

318
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:16,142
My apologies.

319
00:50:16,242 --> 00:50:20,062
I was dealing with an uninvited guest.

320
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:21,926
Have you need then of, say...

321
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:24,142
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

322
00:50:24,242 --> 00:50:27,530
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.

323
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,022
No!

324
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:38,702
Where's Iosef?

325
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,102
Fuck you.

326
00:50:40,202 --> 00:50:42,887
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!

327
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:46,253
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

328
00:50:47,722 --> 00:50:49,724
Give me somethin'.

329
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:55,123
Little Russia.

330
00:50:55,682 --> 00:50:57,982
There's a church near Cannon Court.

331
00:50:58,082 --> 00:51:00,862
- What about it?
- It's a front.

332
00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:03,408
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.

333
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,563
Thank you.

334
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:15,405
Do I know you?

335
00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:18,850
I'm thinkin' so.

336
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,142
Hey, John.

337
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:28,982
Hey, Harry.

338
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:30,662
Everything all right?

339
00:51:30,762 --> 00:51:33,652
Yeah. Everything's fine.

340
00:51:34,642 --> 00:51:37,771
- I'll leave you to it then.
- Hey, Harry.

341
00:51:39,202 --> 00:51:42,782
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

342
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:45,726
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.

343
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:19,769
My son, how might I help you?

344
00:52:26,162 --> 00:52:27,163
Motherfucker!

345
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,370
Let's go to the vault.

346
00:52:52,042 --> 00:52:53,453
Open it.

347
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:01,688
Viggo will kill me.

348
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:21,366
Ladies, out.

349
00:53:34,122 --> 00:53:38,207
Honestly, what do you think
you're going to do with all of that?

350
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,563
This.

351
00:54:28,522 --> 00:54:29,933
Don't worry.

352
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:33,046
Housekeeping will find you.

353
00:54:34,082 --> 00:54:36,062
Treat all your ladies like this?

354
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:39,371
You are no lady. Trust me.

355
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:48,283
Harry, is it?

356
00:54:50,282 --> 00:54:53,286
How would you like to earn
more than just a gold coin?

357
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:57,622
You've broken the rules.

358
00:54:57,722 --> 00:55:00,726
You've done business
on Continental grounds.

359
00:55:01,682 --> 00:55:04,302
And management does not take kindly...

360
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:06,484
to that sort of behavior.

361
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:10,163
Fuck management.

362
00:55:16,322 --> 00:55:18,768
Don't worry. Housekeeping'll find you.

363
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:27,012
Ashes to ashes.

364
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:29,851
Can we recover from this?

365
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,548
Viggo, you know what was
in that vault, right?

366
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:39,012
Shit.

367
00:55:55,722 --> 00:55:57,372
Come on!

368
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,462
I'll say this, John.

369
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:20,452
They sure as fuck
broke the mold with you.

370
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,131
You always had a certain...

371
00:57:37,962 --> 00:57:39,930
audacity about you, you know.

372
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:43,123
Yeah.

373
00:57:46,522 --> 00:57:51,323
I can say you're still very
much the John Wick of old.

374
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:53,812
Am I?

375
00:57:56,962 --> 00:58:00,702
People don't change. You know that.

376
00:58:00,802 --> 00:58:02,964
Times, they do.

377
00:58:06,722 --> 00:58:09,942
Do you know what was in that vault?

378
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:12,062
Artwork, cash, not without its worth.

379
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:14,608
But the leverage I had on this city...

380
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:18,702
audio recordings,
physical evidence, blackmail...

381
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:20,327
it was fuckin' priceless!

382
00:58:21,322 --> 00:58:22,847
Priceless!

383
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:28,173
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

384
00:58:29,002 --> 00:58:30,062
Yeah.

385
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:33,166
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.

386
00:58:34,322 --> 00:58:35,926
Are you really laughing?

387
00:58:42,922 --> 00:58:44,526
So...

388
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:50,982
Ah, then you got married, huh?
Settled down.

389
00:58:51,082 --> 00:58:53,902
How did you manage that anyways?

390
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:55,367
Luck, I guess.

391
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:58,569
Yeah.

392
00:58:58,682 --> 00:59:01,622
Yeah, while you had your wife,
I had my son.

393
00:59:01,722 --> 00:59:04,885
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.

394
00:59:10,202 --> 00:59:11,647
And then you left.

395
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:14,102
And the way you got out...

396
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:19,542
lying to yourself that the past
held no sway over the future.

397
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:21,406
But in the end...

398
00:59:23,082 --> 00:59:27,782
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds...

399
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:31,728
which is why God took your wife...

400
00:59:33,322 --> 00:59:35,893
and unleashed you upon me.

401
00:59:37,562 --> 00:59:40,182
This life...

402
00:59:40,282 --> 00:59:42,284
follows you.

403
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:46,542
It clings to you...

404
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:51,862
infecting everyone
who comes close to you.

405
00:59:51,962 --> 00:59:54,932
We are cursed, you and I.

406
00:59:56,362 --> 00:59:59,764
On that we agree.

407
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:05,809
Finally, common ground.

408
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:08,502
Okay.

409
01:00:08,602 --> 01:00:10,342
Step aside.

410
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:12,968
Give me your son.

411
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:15,251
John Wick.

412
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:24,342
It was just a fucking car.
Just a fuckin' dog.

413
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:26,410
Just a dog.

414
01:00:27,642 --> 01:00:29,212
Viggo.

415
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:34,090
- Yeah?
- When Helen died, I lost everything.

416
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:38,382
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep...

417
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:41,326
a final gift from my wife.

418
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:45,489
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope...

419
01:00:47,802 --> 01:00:50,646
an opportunity to grieve unalone.

420
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,062
And your son...

421
01:00:55,162 --> 01:00:56,732
took that from me.

422
01:00:56,842 --> 01:00:59,982
- Oh, God.
- Stole that from me.

423
01:01:00,082 --> 01:01:02,822
Killed that from me!

424
01:01:02,922 --> 01:01:05,382
People keep asking if I'm back...

425
01:01:05,482 --> 01:01:08,142
and I haven't really had an answer.

426
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:11,702
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back.

427
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,942
So you can either hand over your son...

428
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:18,171
or you can die screaming alongside him!

429
01:03:55,682 --> 01:03:57,650
Cool it. Cool it.

430
01:03:58,642 --> 01:04:00,053
John!

431
01:04:01,682 --> 01:04:03,684
- Jesus.
- Where is he?

432
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:07,126
Shit!

433
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:16,102
I have your word then, if I tell you where
he is, that you'll let me walk away?

434
01:04:16,202 --> 01:04:17,533
Pull the contract.

435
01:04:22,122 --> 01:04:23,169
Done.

436
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:30,902
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.

437
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:33,892
434 Wallace Place.

438
01:04:35,642 --> 01:04:38,168
- They know you're coming.
- Of course.

439
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,964
But it won't matter.

440
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:34,923
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?

441
01:05:47,962 --> 01:05:50,966
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?

442
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,246
Get down! Get down!

443
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,723
Come on! Come on! Get down! Get down!

444
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:36,366
Make the arrangements.

445
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,422
Thank you.

446
01:07:56,522 --> 01:07:58,251
Our pleasure, sir.

447
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:04,982
A parting gift. From the management.

448
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:07,403
Compensation for last
night's unfortunate...

449
01:08:08,602 --> 01:08:10,604
incident.

450
01:08:57,482 --> 01:09:00,382
How many times do I
have to save your ass?

451
01:09:00,482 --> 01:09:03,462
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

452
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:05,542
You look terrible.

453
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,542
No, I look retired.

454
01:09:07,642 --> 01:09:08,982
Retired?

455
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:11,164
You really believe that?

456
01:09:24,962 --> 01:09:26,452
You made a new life.

457
01:09:28,882 --> 01:09:31,010
You'll find your way back to it.

458
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:34,489
It's time to go home.

459
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:32,222
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

460
01:10:32,322 --> 01:10:33,847
Hello, Marcus.

461
01:10:46,482 --> 01:10:47,768
This is John.

462
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:52,371
I appreciate you granting
my son a swift death.

463
01:10:54,682 --> 01:10:57,572
I wouldn't know how to
reply to that either.

464
01:10:59,442 --> 01:11:01,683
Marcus betrayed me.

465
01:11:12,442 --> 01:11:14,662
You pulled the contract.

466
01:11:14,762 --> 01:11:19,422
And while it was open,
you had every chance...

467
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:22,685
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

468
01:11:22,802 --> 01:11:26,022
And if you had done your job...

469
01:11:26,122 --> 01:11:28,363
my son would be still alive!

470
01:11:31,122 --> 01:11:32,702
And in so doing...

471
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:35,248
he broke the cardinal rule.

472
01:11:36,962 --> 01:11:38,487
Thank you.

473
01:11:42,002 --> 01:11:43,049
Ms. Perkins.

474
01:11:44,722 --> 01:11:46,862
Why am I not surprised?

475
01:11:46,962 --> 01:11:49,169
In for a penny, in for a pound.

476
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:54,164
So, John, I had no choice.

477
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:57,443
I always liked you, Marcus.

478
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,969
The last of the old guard.

479
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:13,733
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

480
01:12:14,962 --> 01:12:17,249
No! No!

481
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:21,165
No, my good sir.

482
01:12:22,802 --> 01:12:24,691
I go out on my own.

483
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,363
See?

484
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:00,767
Well played, old friend.

485
01:13:07,802 --> 01:13:10,726
- We done, Viggo?
- We're done.

486
01:13:11,522 --> 01:13:13,182
Okay. Here.

487
01:13:13,282 --> 01:13:14,852
Thank you.

488
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:20,483
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

489
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:47,485
Ms. Perkins, I apologize
for calling you at this hour.

490
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:32,062
Ms. Perkins.

491
01:14:32,162 --> 01:14:34,782
Your membership to the
Continental has been...

492
01:14:34,882 --> 01:14:37,965
by thine own hand, revoked.

493
01:15:04,842 --> 01:15:07,288
I know what you're thinking, Jonathan.

494
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:08,942
We live by a code.

495
01:15:09,042 --> 01:15:10,702
Which is why I'm not the
one telling you that...

496
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:12,702
a certain helicopter
at a certain helipad...

497
01:15:12,802 --> 01:15:15,487
is being fueled for a certain someone.

498
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:36,809
- Have you got my cigarettes?
- Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

499
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,653
Oh, fuck!

500
01:16:04,882 --> 01:16:06,542
Yeah. Super. Let's go. Faster!

501
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:08,883
The helicopter's right down there.
Come on! Let's go!

502
01:16:21,922 --> 01:16:25,165
Shit! Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

503
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,093
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?

504
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:43,891
Somebody give me a gun. Who's got a gun?

505
01:16:45,922 --> 01:16:48,289
Oh, God! My fucking head.

506
01:16:49,322 --> 01:16:52,053
- That was a good one.
- Who's got a gun?

507
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:10,171
Fuck!

508
01:17:26,162 --> 01:17:28,972
The helicopter's right over there.
We have to get over there.

509
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:47,643
I need a gun.

510
01:18:10,042 --> 01:18:12,443
- English, please.
- Good luck.

511
01:18:14,042 --> 01:18:16,044
Russian cocksucker.

512
01:18:17,242 --> 01:18:18,528
Fuck!

513
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,567
No!

514
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:50,410
No more guns, John.

515
01:19:52,762 --> 01:19:54,446
No more bullets.

516
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:57,332
No more bullets.

517
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:07,404
Just you and me, John.

518
01:20:08,122 --> 01:20:09,328
You and me.

519
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:34,492
What happened, John?

520
01:20:35,402 --> 01:20:37,942
We were professionals. Civilized.

521
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:40,170
Do I look civilized to you?

522
01:22:03,122 --> 01:22:05,011
Be seeing you, John.

523
01:22:07,242 --> 01:22:08,607
Yeah.

524
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:11,366
Be seeing you.

525
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:05,486
Come on, John. Let's go home.

526
01:24:49,962 --> 01:24:51,612
It's okay.

527
01:24:52,522 --> 01:24:53,762
Let's go home.

528
01:32:03,962 --> 01:32:07,422
"John, I'm sorry
I can't be there for you.

529
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,969
But you still need something,
someone to love.

530
01:32:11,682 --> 01:32:13,502
So start with this.

531
01:32:13,602 --> 01:32:16,606
Because the car doesn't count.

532
01:32:16,722 --> 01:32:18,502
I love you, John.

533
01:32:18,602 --> 01:32:20,862
This illness has loomed
over us for a long time...

534
01:32:20,962 --> 01:32:24,444
and now that I have
found my peace, find yours.

535
01:32:24,562 --> 01:32:28,726
Until that day,
your best friend, Helen."

536
01:32:56,482 --> 01:32:58,166
Is this true?

537
01:33:11,242 --> 01:33:12,767
Hey.

538
01:33:14,482 --> 01:33:16,928
Oh. Right.

539
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,603
What?

540
01:33:41,362 --> 01:33:43,968
We'll grab you some kibble later.

541
01:34:59,962 --> 01:35:01,088
Hey.

542
01:35:04,442 --> 01:35:05,967
Hey.

543
01:36:45,522 --> 01:36:46,933
Yo, Aurelio!

544
01:36:48,122 --> 01:36:51,888
Huh? I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

545
01:36:52,962 --> 01:36:54,964
Where'd you get that car?

546
01:36:56,242 --> 01:36:58,542
- John Wick?
- Yes.

547
01:36:58,642 --> 01:37:00,246

And the pen.

549
01:37:10,202 --> 01:37:11,302
Sorry.

550
01:37:11,402 --> 01:37:13,689
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

551
01:37:27,802 --> 01:37:29,725
Good-bye, John.

552
01:38:53,122 --> 01:38:54,283
Just an anniversary.

553
01:40:07,122 --> 01:40:08,692
Daisy.

554
01:40:10,202 --> 01:40:11,772
Of course.

555
01:40:16,522 --> 01:40:17,603
Hey.

556
01:40:23,282 --> 01:40:24,772
Come on.

557
01:40:29,722 --> 01:40:32,043
- How much?
- Excuse me?

558
01:40:32,762 --> 01:40:34,366
How much for the car?

559
01:40:35,442 --> 01:40:37,206
She's not for sale.

560
01:40:40,202 --> 01:40:42,091
Oh, I love dogs.

561
01:40:53,882 --> 01:40:56,362
You have good day, sir.
